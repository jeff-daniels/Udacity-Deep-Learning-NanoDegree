## Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
### Neural Networks
Learn neural network basics, and build a network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep
learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.
In this project, Neural Network was built from scratch and trained to predict the number of
bikeshare users on a given day.
