# Udacity-Deep-Learning-NanoDegree
This repository contains projects completed for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. 
### Neural Networks
Learn neural network basics, and build a network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep
learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.
In this project, Neural Network was built from scratch and trained to predict the number of
bikeshare users on a given day.  

Dataset: San Francisco Bike Share  
Applied:
- PyTorch Neural Network
- numpy


## Project 2: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App
### Convolutional Neural Networks
In this project, a pipeline was built that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  

Dataset: Dog Images grouped by dog breed  
Applied:
- PyTorch Convolutional Network

## Project 3: TV Script Generation  
### Recurrent Neural Networks
Recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks were built with PyTorch.  Sentiment analysis was performed and recurrent networks were used to generate new text from TV scripts.

Dataset: Seinfeld Scripts  
Applied:
- PyTorch LSTM

## Project 4: Face Generation
### Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network  
A DCGAN was defined and trained on a dataset of faces. The goal was to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible.  

Dataset: CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)  
Applied:
- PyTorch DCGAN

## Project 5: Sentiment Analysis Web App
### SageMaker Deployment
A simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. 

Dataset: IMDB Movie Reviews  
Applied:  
- Amazon Web Services
- SageMaker
- PyTorch LSTM Classifier
