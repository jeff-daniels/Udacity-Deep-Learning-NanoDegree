## Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
### Neural Networks
Learn neural network basics, and build a network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep
learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.
In this project, Neural Network was built from scratch and trained to predict the number of
bikeshare users on a given day.

## Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App
In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!)
