## Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
### Neural Networks
Learn neural network basics, and build a network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep
learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.
In this project, Neural Network was built from scratch and trained to predict the number of
bikeshare users on a given day.  
Applied:
- python
- numpy
- pytorch

## Project 2: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App
### Convolutional Neural Networks
In this project, a pipeline was built that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  
Applied:
- pytorch
- argparse
